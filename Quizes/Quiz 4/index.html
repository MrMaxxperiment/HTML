	<h4>THE GIRL I HATE</h4>
	<p>So I'm eating scones with the girl I hate. The scones are her idea. She says eating one of them is like getting fucked. Not vanilla-style either, the kind with whips. She's eating the scones and I'm watching, sipping black tea with milk but no sugar. Actually, she hasn't quite started yet. She's still spreading clotted cream on each half of the split scone, then homemade jam on top of that. As she does this, she warns me she might make groaning noises. Just so, you know, I know. That's fine, I shrug, feeling little bits of me catch fire. I've got the teacup in my hand, my finger crooked in the little handle that's too small for it so the circulation's getting cut off. I watch her bite into the scone with her little bunny teeth. I watch gobs of clotted cream catch in either corner of her lip. She tilts her head back, closes her eyes, starts to make what must be the groaning noises. I pour myself more tea and cup it in both hands like it's warming them, even though it's gone cold. Then I pretend to look out the window at the dismal view of the Grassmarket. I say, "Busy in the office this morning," and try not to think Cunt.

She is after all, a friend and colleague.

"What?" She says, her mouth full of scone. She hasn't heard me because of her groans.
